# Brain_tumor_MLProject
Me and my friend sriraj did an anyalysis using magnetic resonance images
We did a background study on this disease and classified the images based on it classification
We used 3 different Image Classification algorithms namely VGG 16, Resnet 50, and Efficient Net B series
We made a GUI where a user  can upload the MRI image and the model will predict the Result.
